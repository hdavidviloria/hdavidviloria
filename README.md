<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm David</h1>
<h2 align="center">A passionate sophomore student who always likes to learn something new!</h3>


### ðŸ”­ One thing to know about me is that I LOVE efficiency.

- I absolutely HATE repetitive work. That's why I'm absolutely passionate about automationÂ â€”Â and try to incorporate it as much as possible into my daily workflows!

- Every time I have a task, or a workflow which I need to do, I think to myself "What's one way I can make this more efficient? How can I automate this?"

Below, you see some very simple projects here which I created, that helped me achieve that. For example, as part of my role as my school's Pupil Council Treasurer, I deal a lot with spreadsheets, and so I've created several systems to help automate financial tracking. Another repository I created is an automated spelling bee quizzer, which took the role of helping to test me for a Spelling Bee. 

Excited to share it with you here!


### ðŸŒ± One thing I'm absolutely interested and continually in is GenAI, and its tremendous possible applications! 

I really do believe it has the opportunity to shape our work tremendously, and automate it like we've never seen before. A project that I've been really excited watching is Daniel Miessler's <a href="https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric">Fabric repository.</a> It really changed my workflow and the way I viewed Large Language Models.
